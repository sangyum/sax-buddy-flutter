# Initial Assessment Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the initial assessment feature for the SaxAI Coach app. The initial assessment provides new users with a baseline skill evaluation through 4 predefined exercises, establishing their skill level for personalized practice routine generation.

## Feature Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **4 Static Exercises**: Pre-defined assessment exercises for all new users
- **5-Second Countdown**: Preparation time before recording starts
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicator showing "Exercise X of 4"
- **Recording Interface**: Large recording button with visual feedback
- **Exercise Navigation**: Ability to move between exercises
- **Skill Classification**: Basic skill level determination from results

### UI Requirements (Based on mockup Screen 3)
- **Progress Bar**: Shows current exercise progress
- **Exercise Card**: Large card with exercise instructions
- **Recording Button**: Large red button matching mockup design
- **Recording Indicator**: "REC" indicator and recording status
- **Waveform Display**: Visual feedback during recording (placeholder)
- **Navigation**: Previous/Next exercise buttons

## Exercise Definitions

Based on `InitialAssessment.md`, the 4 exercises are:

### 1. C Major Scale
- **Duration**: 45 seconds
- **Tempo**: 80 BPM
- **Instructions**: "Play C Major scale, one octave, quarter notes"
- **Analysis Focus**: Pitch accuracy, finger coordination, timing consistency

### 2. C Major Arpeggio  
- **Duration**: 45 seconds
- **Tempo**: 70 BPM
- **Instructions**: "Play C-E-G-C arpeggio, two octaves, quarter notes"
- **Analysis Focus**: Interval accuracy, large leap control, technical facility

### 3. Octave Jumps
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Instructions**: "Play Low G to High G, Low A to High A, Low Bb to High Bb with quarter rest between jumps"
- **Analysis Focus**: Range capability, register transitions, intonation consistency

### 4. Dynamic Control Scale
- **Duration**: 1 minute
- **Instructions**: "Play C Major scale with crescendo ascending, diminuendo descending"
- **Analysis Focus**: Breath control, dynamic range, musical expression

### Data Models

#### AssessmentExercise
```dart
class AssessmentExercise {
  final int id;
  final String title;
  final String instructions;
  final Duration duration;
  final int? tempo;
  final List<String> focusAreas;
}
```

#### AssessmentSession
```dart
class AssessmentSession {
  final String id;
  final DateTime startTime;
  final int currentExerciseIndex;
  final List<ExerciseResult> completedExercises;
  final AssessmentSessionState state;
}
```

### State Management

#### Recording States
1. **Setup**: Show exercise instructions, ready to start
2. **Countdown**: 5-second countdown with cancel option
3. **Recording**: Active recording with visual feedback
4. **Complete**: Exercise finished, ready for next

#### Assessment Provider
- Manages overall assessment session state
- Handles exercise navigation and progress
- Controls countdown timer and recording states
- Processes exercise results

### User Experience Flow

#### 1. Assessment Entry
- User taps "New Assessment" on dashboard
- Check if user has completed initial assessment
- If not completed → Start initial assessment
- If completed → Future: on-demand assessment

#### 2. Assessment Introduction
- Welcome screen explaining the assessment
- Overview of 4 exercises and expected duration (~5 minutes)
- "Start Assessment" button to begin

#### 3. Exercise Flow (Repeated 4 times)
1. **Exercise Display**: Show exercise instructions and details
2. **Start Recording**: User taps large recording button
3. **Countdown**: 5-second countdown (5, 4, 3, 2, 1...)
4. **Recording**: Record audio with visual feedback
5. **Completion**: Exercise complete, option to continue

#### 4. Assessment Completion
- Summary of completed exercises
- Basic skill assessment results
- "Generate Practice Routine" button

### Integration Points

#### Dashboard Integration
- Update "New Assessment" card in QuickActions
- Navigate to `/assessment` route
- Show assessment status in dashboard

#### User Model Updates
```dart
class User {
  // ... existing fields
  bool hasCompletedInitialAssessment;
  DateTime? lastAssessmentDate;
  String? currentSkillLevel; // 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced'
}
```

#### Navigation
- Add `/assessment` route to app routing
- Handle back navigation and assessment cancellation
- Navigate to practice routine generation after completion

### Design System Compliance

#### Colors (from mockup)
- **Primary**: #2E5266 (recording button, progress, headers)
- **Recording Red**: #E53E3E (recording state, REC indicator)
- **Background**: #FAFAFA
- **Card Background**: #FFFFFF with #E0E0E0 border

#### Typography
- **Exercise Title**: 16sp, semibold
- **Instructions**: 14sp, regular
- **Progress**: 12sp, medium
- **Countdown**: 48sp, bold

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- Exercise models and data validation
- Assessment provider state management
- Countdown timer logic
- Exercise navigation

#### Widget Tests
- Countdown widget animation
- Recording button states
- Exercise progress indicator
- Exercise card display

#### Integration Tests
- Complete assessment flow
- Navigation between exercises
- State persistence during assessment

### Future Considerations

#### Phase 2 Enhancements
- Audio recording and analysis integration
- Real-time pitch detection feedback
- Detailed skill assessment algorithms
- Assessment result analytics

#### On-Demand Assessment
- LLM-generated exercise variations
- Skill progression tracking
- Adaptive difficulty based on performance

## Implementation Notes

### No Audio Recording (Current Phase)
- Recording button shows visual feedback only
- Timer runs for exercise duration
- Results are placeholder for future audio analysis
- Focus on UI/UX and navigation flow

### TDD Approach
- Write failing tests first for each component
- Implement minimal code to pass tests
- Refactor for clean, maintainable code
- Follow existing project testing patterns

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the assessment feature while maintaining focus on the initial assessment scope and preparing for future enhancements.
