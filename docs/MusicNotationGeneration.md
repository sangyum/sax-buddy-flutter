# Music Notation Generation Strategy

## Executive Summary

**Decision**: Migrate from `simple_sheet_music` to OpenSheetMusicDisplay (OSMD) with MusicXML generation for MVP, establishing a clear path to native implementation for production scale.

**Date**: 2025-07-14  
**Status**: Approved for Implementation

## Current State Analysis

### simple_sheet_music Package Limitations

The current `simple_sheet_music` package (v1.0.1) has significant limitations that impact the saxophone learning experience:

#### Missing Critical Features
- **Time Signatures**: No support for displaying time signatures (4/4, 3/4, etc.)
- **Vertical Bar Lines**: Missing measure separators and end-of-measure indicators
- **Repeat Marks**: No support for repeat signs, dal segno, or other navigation marks
- **Dynamics**: No support for crescendo, diminuendo, forte, piano markings
- **Articulations**: Missing staccato, legato, accent marks
- **Advanced Notation**: No support for grace notes, trills, or ornaments

#### Technical Issues
- **Unpredictable Sizing**: Package dynamically adjusts size internally, making legibility inconsistent
- **Limited Control**: Cannot reliably predict or control how sheet music will render
- **Basic Functionality**: Only supports basic note/rest rendering with minimal musical context

### Current Implementation
- Located in: `lib/features/notation/widgets/notation_view.dart`
- Uses `simple_sheet_music` package for rendering
- Receives `List<Measure>` from `SimpleSheetMusicService`
- AI generates custom JSON format converted to package-specific objects

## Research Findings

### OpenAI LLM MusicXML Generation Capabilities

**✅ Confirmed**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini can generate MusicXML directly with high accuracy.

#### Proven Capabilities
- **Direct MusicXML Output**: Can generate valid XML with proper structure
- **Musical Understanding**: Handles time signatures, key signatures, note relationships
- **Saxophone Expertise**: Understands treble clef, Bb transposition, appropriate ranges
- **Complex Structures**: Can create multi-measure etudes with proper musical flow

#### Current JSON vs MusicXML Complexity
- **Current**: Custom JSON with nested objects for pitch/duration
- **MusicXML**: Standard XML structure with established schema
- **Conversion**: MusicXML actually simpler - direct mapping of musical concepts

#### Example Transformation
```json
// Current JSON
{"pitch": "c4", "duration": "quarter", "accidental": null}

// Equivalent MusicXML
<note>
  <pitch><step>C</step><octave>4</octave></pitch>
  <duration>1</duration>
  <type>quarter</type>
</note>
```

### Alternative Solutions Evaluated

#### 1. VexFlow + WebView (Evaluated)
- **Pros**: Mature (10+ years), full notation support, cross-platform
- **Cons**: Custom JavaScript integration, non-standard format
- **Complexity**: Medium - requires custom JSON to VexFlow API conversion

#### 2. OpenSheetMusicDisplay (OSMD) + WebView (RECOMMENDED)
- **Pros**: Industry standard MusicXML, professional rendering, VexFlow-based
- **Cons**: WebView overhead, web-based solution
- **Complexity**: Low-Medium - direct MusicXML rendering

#### 3. Native Platform Solutions (Future)
- **Options**: SeeScore SDK (commercial), alphaTab (cross-platform)
- **Pros**: Best performance, native feel, complete control
- **Cons**: High complexity, platform-specific code, licensing costs
- **Complexity**: High - requires platform channels and native development

## AI Generation Architecture Decision

### Two-Prompt Strategy (Updated 2025-07-14)

**Decision**: Split AI generation into two separate, focused prompts for better reliability and quality.

#### Current Single-Prompt Issues
1. **Token Limit Constraints**: MusicXML is verbose - generating multiple etudes in one prompt quickly hits token limits
2. **Context Mixing**: Practice routine logic (pedagogical) vs notation generation (technical) are different AI skills
3. **Error Propagation**: If MusicXML generation fails, entire response fails, losing good practice routine content
4. **Prompt Complexity**: Current prompt is already long and trying to do two distinct tasks

#### New Two-Prompt Architecture

**Prompt 1: Practice Routine Generation**
- **Focus**: Pure pedagogical expertise - exercise selection, progression, targeting weaknesses
- **Input**: Assessment data, user skill level, identified weaknesses
- **Output**: Clean JSON with exercise metadata (name, description, duration, difficulty)
- **Advantages**: Smaller responses, better reliability, easier validation

**Prompt 2: MusicXML Generation Per Exercise**
- **Focus**: Pure musical notation - convert exercise concept to playable etude
- **Input**: Single exercise description + musical requirements (key, tempo, difficulty)
- **Output**: Valid MusicXML for that specific exercise
- **Advantages**: Better MusicXML quality, can retry individual etudes, more musical detail

#### Implementation Flow
```dart
// 1. Generate practice routines (pedagogical focus)
final routines = await generatePracticeRoutines(dataset);

// 2. Generate MusicXML for each exercise (musical focus)
for (final routine in routines) {
  for (final exercise in routine.exercises) {
    final musicXML = await generateEtudeMusicXML(exercise);
    exercise.musicXML = musicXML;
  }
}
```

#### Benefits
- **Parallel Processing**: Can generate multiple etudes concurrently
- **Selective Regeneration**: Re-generate just the etude if musical notation fails
- **Specialized Prompts**: Each prompt optimized for its specific task
- **Better Error Handling**: Practice routines always succeed even if some etudes fail
- **A/B Testing**: Easier to test different musical generation approaches
