# Firebase App Distribution Integration Summary

## Changes Made

‚úÖ **Modified GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`) to include Firebase App Distribution for both Android and iOS builds using `nickwph/firebase-app-distribution-action@v1`.

## Key Features Added

### ü§ñ **Android Distribution**
- Uploads APK file to Firebase App Distribution after successful build
- Only runs on `main` branch pushes to avoid distributing test builds
- Automatically generates release notes with commit information
- Distributes to `testers` group

### üçé **iOS Distribution**
- Creates IPA file from the built iOS app
- Uploads IPA to Firebase App Distribution
- Only runs on `main` branch pushes
- Automatically generates release notes with commit information
- Distributes to `testers` group

### üìù **Release Notes**
Automatically generated release notes include:
- Commit SHA
- Commit message
- Branch name
- Emoji indicators for build type

## Required GitHub Secrets

To make this work, you need to configure these secrets in your GitHub repository:

### New Secrets Needed:
1. **`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`** - Firebase service account JSON for authentication (used as `credentials` parameter)
2. **`FIREBASE_ANDROID_APP_ID`** - Firebase Android app ID (format: `1:123456789:android:abc123def456`, used as `app` parameter)
3. **`FIREBASE_IOS_APP_ID`** - Firebase iOS app ID (format: `1:123456789:ios:abc123def456`, used as `app` parameter)

### Already Configured:
- ‚úÖ `GOOGLE_SERVICES_BASE64` - Base64 encoded google-services.json for Android
- ‚úÖ `GOOGLE_SERVICE_INFO_PLIST_BASE64` - Base64 encoded GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS

## How to Set Up

1. **Firebase Console Setup:**
   - Enable Firebase App Distribution in your project
   - Create a "testers" group and add email addresses
   - Create a service account with Firebase App Distribution Admin role

2. **GitHub Secrets Setup:**
   - Add the three new secrets listed above
   - See `.github/FIREBASE_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

3. **Test the Workflow:**
   - Push changes to `main` branch
   - Check GitHub Actions for successful build and distribution
   - Verify testers receive email notifications

## Workflow Behavior

### On Push to `main`:
- ‚úÖ Runs tests
- ‚úÖ Builds Android APK and AAB
- ‚úÖ Builds iOS IPA
- ‚úÖ Distributes both to Firebase App Distribution
- ‚úÖ Notifies testers via email

### On Push to `develop` or PR:
- ‚úÖ Runs tests
- ‚úÖ Builds Android APK and AAB
- ‚úÖ Builds iOS IPA
- ‚ùå **Does NOT** distribute to Firebase (saves on distribution limits)

## Benefits

- **Automated Distribution**: No manual steps needed for beta releases
- **Instant Notifications**: Testers get immediate email alerts
- **Release Tracking**: Automatic versioning and release notes
- **Easy Testing**: Testers can install directly from email links
- **Cost Effective**: Only distributes production-ready builds from `main`

## Action Parameters

The workflow now uses `nickwph/firebase-app-distribution-action@v1` with these parameters:
- `app`: Firebase App ID (from secrets)
- `credentials`: Service account JSON (from secrets)
- `groups`: Distribution groups (set to "testers")
- `file`: Path to APK/IPA file
- `release-notes`: Auto-generated release notes with commit info

## Next Steps

1. Configure the required GitHub secrets
2. Set up Firebase App Distribution tester groups
3. Test the workflow by pushing to `main`
4. Monitor build logs for any issues
5. Train testers on how to install from Firebase Distribution emails
